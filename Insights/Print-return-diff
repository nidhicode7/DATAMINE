Sure! Here's the difference between `return` and `print()` explained with side headings:

---

### 1. **Purpose**

* `return`: Sends a value **back to the caller** (function or variable).
* `print()`: Simply **displays** the value on the screen.

---

### 2. **Reusability**

* `return`: The returned value can be **stored in a variable** and used later.
* `print()`: The printed value **cannot be reused** in calculations or logic.

---

### 3. **Output**

* `return`: Gives back the result silently. To see it, you must **print the variable** storing it.
* `print()`: **Immediately shows the result** in the console.

---

### 4. **Return Type**

* `return`: Returns the actual value (e.g., number, string, list).
* `print()`: Returns `None`.

---

### 5. **Usage Example**

```python
def add_return(a, b):
    return a + b

def add_print(a, b):
    print(a + b)
```

Using `return`:

```python
result = add_return(5, 3)
print(result * 2)  # Output: 16 ✅
```

Using `print()`:

```python
result = add_print(5, 3)  # Output: 8
print(result * 2)         # Error ❌ (result is None)
```
